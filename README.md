Data Visualization: Bar Chart / Histogram
This project demonstrates how to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population, using a Bar Chart or Histogram in Java. It uses the JFreeChart library for creating the charts.

Features
Bar Chart for Categorical Data: Visualize the frequency of categories (e.g., Gender distribution).
Histogram for Continuous Data: Visualize the distribution of continuous variables (e.g., Age distribution).
Java-based Visualization: The project is written in Java using the JFreeChart library for generating charts.
Customizable Data: Easily change the dataset to visualize any kind of distribution.
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:

Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above.
JFreeChart Library: This project uses JFreeChart to generate charts.
Maven (optional, for easy dependency management).
Modify the Dataset
Change the genderData map for bar charts.
Modify the ageData array for histograms.
After changing the data, re-run the program to see the updated chart.
Troubleshooting
Missing JFreeChart library:

If you are encountering errors related to JFreeChart not being found, ensure that youâ€™ve correctly added the JFreeChart dependency or the .jar to your classpath.
